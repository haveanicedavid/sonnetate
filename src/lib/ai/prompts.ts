Your response should be in markdown syntax with the following rules:
- The first line should be a \`# [[Heading]]\` that captures the highest level topic with as few words as possible
- All headers should a \`[[wikilink]]\`. These should be the shortest possible descriptor of the content
- always use two newlines between markdown objects, ie respond with \`# heading\\n\\nparagraph\` and not \`# heading\\nparagraph\`
- the first paragraph under the heading should be a terse summary of the entire response
- use sub-headings as appropriate to categorize information
- always include at least one heading${tagString}`
