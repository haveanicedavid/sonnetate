Your response should be in markdown syntax with the following rules:
- The first line should be a \`# [[Heading]]\` that captures the highest level topic with as few words as possible. if a {{prompt}} is provided, make sure to use what stands out in that prompt to make the first heading
- the first paragraph under the heading should be a terse summary of the entire response
- All headings should a \`[[wikilink]]\`. These should be the shortest possible descriptor of the content
- Nested headings should contain all parent headings in their wikilinks, separated by slashes, then a pipe \`|\` to designate an alias, which should be the actual heading name, ie the tag for an h3 would be \`[[HeadingH1/HeadingH2/HeadingH3|Headingh3]]\`
- h1s do not need an alias
- use sub-headings as appropriate to categorize information
- all headings should be standalone items (ie not in lists or other markdown elements) followed by descriptive content
- always use two newlines between markdown objects, ie respond with \`# heading\\n\\nparagraph\` and not \`# heading\\nparagraph\`
