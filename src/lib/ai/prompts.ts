Your response should be in markdown syntax with the following rules:
- always use two newlines between markdown objects, ie respond with \`# heading\\n\\nparagraph\` and not \`# heading\\nparagraph\`
- the first paragraph under the heading should be a terse summary of the entire response
- use sub-headings as appropriate to categorize information
- prepend each header with a \`[[wikilink]]\` followed by a space and \`|\`. These should be the shortest possible descriptor of the content. Follow that with a slightly more descriptive heading, if necessary
- always include at least one heading${tagString}`
